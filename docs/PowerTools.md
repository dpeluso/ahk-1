# PowerTools

This repository provide several tools bundled together under the term "PowerTools".

These are:
- Teamsy
- Teams Shortcuts
- NWS PowerTool
- People Connector
- Outlook Shortcuts

These tools are implemented in this directory using AutoHotkey.

You can run them either from the source AHK files if you have AutoHotkey installed
or as compiled standalone .exe version (no need for AutoHotkey installation in this case.)

You can set them up and check for updates using the PowerTool Bundler.
