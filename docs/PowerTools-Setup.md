# PowerTools Setup

## One-by-one Setup

You can download for each PowerTool the .exe file by going here: [repo root->PowerTools](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/tree/master/PowerTools) and clicking on the file you want and then click the Download button.

It is recommended to install it in a separate fresh directory because some auxiliary files will be downloaded or created on the same level (e.g. PowerBundler, git_updater, ini file...).

From each PowerTool you can access functions from the System tray icon context menu (right-mouse click on the icon in the system tray).

From there you have access to basic settings and links. For example you can open the Help, changelogs. You can also set the specific tool to start automatically at startup and activate or deactivate the notification at startup.


## PowerTools Bundler

If you want to manage multiple PowerTools together, the best way is to use the [PowerTools Bundler](PowerTools-Bundler).
You can download the standalone version by clicking directly [here](https://github.com/tdalon/ahk/raw/master/PowerTools/PowerToolsBundler.exe).

At the best you store it in a new fresh directory with the name **PowerTools** for example because all other PowerTools will be saved in this directory as well as some helper files (git_updater, ini file...).
